# Project Description

The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a user-level file system (File System, FS) that stores its contents in primary memory. The file system is called TecnicoFS.

## Exercise 1

The goal of this exercise is to create an initial parallel version of the TecnicoFS server. This version does not support interaction with client processes, but instead executes sequences of calls loaded from an input file. For debugging purposes, the server will display the total execution time on stdout and write the final directory content to an output file.
